# Official Website Project

Ok, I'm not sure what happened here... I wanted to push the commits to my original repo to the master branch. But I guess since the folder on this computer was named differently, I had to upload it like this? That can't be it right? I'll figure it out later cause I have homework to do.

## Short update

I've completed my classes. Now I can focus on my website. I want it to look nice, and I know how to style a page, but I don't know exactly what "nice" looks like. So I'm going to play around with CSS for a bit... then see what happens. Later, I'll focus on JavaScript.

My only problem with CSS is all the positioning stuff. If I wanted to make a website look like a newspaper with all its columns then I'd have to take extensive notes on what I do exactly.
