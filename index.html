            <h2>February 21 2024</h2>
            <p>I'm more energetic than normal today (not that anybody would notice) because I'm actually getting stuff done. It's a good feeling.</p>
            <p>I tend to avoid things I don't understand. I'm not studying for Matrix Methods right now, for example. That's why I took so long to create this account and start studying up on Git and GitHub.</p>
            <p>I also like beating myself up when I don't accomplish the things I want to, like making an A in my classes, or talking to a girl, or going to the gym.</p>
            <p>But I've had this fire to start picking up more challenging projects recently, and it's kinda given me purpose. I just need to do something!</p>
            <p>Yeah if I'm not doing something productive I feel really bad. Where am I going with this? OH yeah, I'm just glad I've found where I can focus. I like doing this!</p>
            <p>Even though right now I'm making a blog post on a crappy website that isn't even a blog.</p>
            <p>But as long as I'm being productive for MYSELF, that's what matters. Because this experience is gonna GREATLY help me in the future!</p>
            <p>Anyway that's why I was saying I should start a blog, because then I could put something out there for the business world to see, while also keeping myself in the playground. I want to have fun AND learn.</p>

            <h2>May 4 2024</h2>
            <p>YEAH, I KNOW, I suck at doing things regularly. I have a feeling about this summer, though. I passed Operating Systems, and I feel literally invincible!!!!</p>
            <p>Passing Operating Systems is a HUGE deal for me, and it's not because of the actual course material. That was the only easy part. The HARD part was everything stopping my progress.</p>
            <p>That includes my professor. That guy does NOT know how to teach. At all.</p>
            <p>There is a process for teachers I feel I could teach my Operating Systems professor about in order to get him to get better at his job. I get this from my time at Mathnasium when I taught kids.</p>
            <p>When I met students, I would introduce myself, ask what grade they were in, and talk about things they like for a bit, which helps connect us and makes it easier for us both to understand the things we communicate about.</p>
            <p>That allowed me to later adapt to a student's learning methods based on how they performed and reacted. For instance, if I was teaching a student about fractions, I'd use the example of a pizza being cut into slices.</p>
            <p>My professor didn't even bother to ask if we understood the material. Not once, and at no level, did he ever express concern for our comfort in his traditional, boring, pointless lectures.</p>
            <p>I say pointless because they truly are pointless - I used ChatGPT to teach myself every aspect and every subtopic of each chapter of his lecture PowerPoints.</p>
            <p>And that's another thing! His PowerPoints were so convoluted, wordy, and difficult to decipher that I had to send its contents to ChatGPT in order to decipher their stupid sentences.</p>
            <p>So. I pat myself on the back for having access to one more resource that helps me teach myself anything I want - ChatGPT. I've gotten pretty good at teaching myself things.</p>
            <p>And by passing Operating Systems class with that god-awful professor, I've proven to myself that I can use the resources I have to their fullest capabilities and overcome any of the obstacles in my path. Not even exaggerating.</p>
            <p>So honestly, what's stopping me from getting any position I want at any company? I know how to learn, and I know how to teach myself. Since companies and recruiters have their own individual requirements, all they need to do is communicate what exactly they want, and adept learners like me can EASILY provide, with both our resources and the expertise we already have.</p>
