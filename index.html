            <p>I'm more energetic than normal today (not that anybody would notice) because I'm actually getting stuff done. It's a good feeling.</p>
            <p>I tend to avoid things I don't understand. I'm not studying for Matrix Methods right now, for example. That's why I took so long to create this account and start studying up on Git and GitHub.</p>
            <p>I also like beating myself up when I don't accomplish the things I want to, like making an A in my classes, or talking to a girl, or going to the gym.</p>
            <p>But I've had this fire to start picking up more challenging projects recently, and it's kinda given me purpose. I just need to do something!</p>
            <p>Yeah if I'm not doing something productive I feel really bad. Where am I going with this? OH yeah, I'm just glad I've found where I can focus. I like doing this!</p>
            <p>Even though right now I'm making a blog post on a crappy website that isn't even a blog.</p>
            <p>But as long as I'm being productive for MYSELF, that's what matters. Because this experience is gonna GREATLY help me in the future!</p>
            <p>Anyway that's why I was saying I should start a blog, because then I could put something out there for the business world to see, while also keeping myself in the playground. I want to have fun AND learn.</p>
